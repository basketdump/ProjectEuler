'''
Problem 6 of Project Euler
--------------------------
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of
the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum
is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of
the first one hundred natural numbers and the square
of the sum.

# answer: (1 + ... + n)^2 - (1^2 + ... + n^2)

    # 2. Sum (built-in)
    # 3. Define square_of_sums and sum_of_squares

# TODO: CAN THIS FUNCTION BE RECURSIVE?
# NOTE: I did do an improved version of this
#       but I don't see how this could be recursive
#       with having to square it at the end.
#       Summing only can definitely be recursive, though.
